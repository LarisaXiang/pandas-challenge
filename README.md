Written Report

Based on the below datasets, it is evident that the performance of a school cannot be attributed to a single factor but is influenced by multiple reasons.

When examining the data for Top Performing Schools and Bottom Performing Schools, we observe a noteworthy trend. Among the top-five performing schools, three are independent schools, while four out of the five worst-performing schools are government schools. This trend suggests that independent schools tend to outperform government schools in terms of academic performance. And the the Scores by School Type data table reinforces this observation. 
When analyzing the Scores by School Spending dataset, we discover that there is no absolute correlation between students' academic scores and the amount spent on education. Contrary to expectations, the range of $585-630 shows the best scores, closely followed by the group with spending less than $585. However, the group with the highest spending ($645-680) records the worst scores. 
Additionally, the Scores by School Size summary table indicates smaller school sizes tend to result in higher scores.

In conclusion, the data demonstrates that the performance of a school is influenced by a combination of factors rather than a single determinant. Independent schools tend to perform better than government schools, and academic success cannot be solely attributed to the amount of money spent on education. Moreover, smaller-sized schools appear to provide an advantage to students in terms of academic achievement.
